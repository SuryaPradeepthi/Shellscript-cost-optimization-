# Shellscript-cost-optimization-
Created a shell script to optimize cost

To optimize the cost of the ELK(elastic logstash kibana) stack, the client sought to reduce the expenses associated with their self-hosted solution. The process began by setting up an EC2 instance, followed by installing Java and Jenkins on the instance. Inbound rules were configured on the security group to allow TCP traffic on port 8080. The Jenkins dashboard was accessible through a browser by navigating to `http://<ec2-public-IP>:8080`. Next, the Jenkins user was configured, and a Docker pipeline was set up under the 'Manage Jenkins' section, with Jenkins being restarted to apply the changes. Docker was then installed on the EC2 instance, along with the AWS CLI, and the AWS credentials were configured using `aws configure`. A simple Jenkins job was created, and a shell script was written to automate the process of uploading log files to Amazon S3. The script (`s3upload.sh`) was executed using the command `./s3upload.sh`. With this setup, log files, previously stored in an ElasticSearch database, were now uploaded to S3. This solution leveraged S3's lifecycle management to transition infrequently accessed log files to Glacier or Deep Archive storage, resulting in significant cost reduction for the client.
